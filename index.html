        <h1> BroadBand</h1>
        <p>  BroadBand is a web-based resource developed with the Shiny R framework, designed for the exploration of genomic data selected among a comprehensive selection of breast cancer (BRCA) studies with available information on somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs). BroadBand allows an intuitive and custom navigation of SNVs and SCNAs data which can be filtered and summarized at different resolution levels, from gene to chromosome, and stratified across the different breast cancer histotypes and tumor classifications.</p>
